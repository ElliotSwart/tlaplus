* When you execute a system command with the exec method of the Runtime    *
* class, the output produced by the command is put into a buffer.  If      *
* that buffer fills up, the command hangs waiting for the output to be     *
* read from that buffer.  A GobbleOutput object is used to read that       *
* output from the buffer and throw it away.                                *
*                                                                          *
* A GobbleOutput object is a thread.  The code                             *
*                                                                          *
*    GobbleOutput threadObj = new GobbleOutput(bool, proc, str);           *
*    threadObj.start() ;                                                   *
*                                                                          *
* launches a thread that reads and throws away the output produced         *
* by Process proc on either stdout (if bool = true) or stderr (if          *
* bool = false).  If you're not sure where proc sends its output,          *
* you can launch two threads to read both output streams.                  *
*                                                                          *
* The String str is the name of the command, and is used only for an       *
* error message.                                                           *
